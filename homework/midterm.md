I will make a narrative website about the juxtaposition of Le Corbusier's modernist
manifesto and Postcolonial Indonesia: Architecture, Urban space and political cultures 
as a parallel to my senior thesis. The website will heighten juxtaposition of image and text,
as one scrolls down the website, images will pop up at different intervals in relation
to the content's relevance. At the same time, there will be a reading of the text as 
a juxtaposed sensory experience to reading and hearing.
